# RitualReader

This is my repository for my AHK script RitualReader, which is made to read out the costs of items in the Ritual reward screen of Path of Exile.
This is not a release version, this is not stable. It is in beta, with no promise to ever be fully released.
This does currently work on my setup, and some other tester's as well.

## Requirements:

AutoHotKey v2.0 (or later) from https://www.autohotkey.com/
1920x1080 (or higher) display resolution

One helpful tester has indicated it works with windowed POE at 1920x1080 within a larger resolution display. 

## Setup:

Edit line 17 of the script to use your chosen dirve and directory.
Optionally adjust the settings on line 18 and 19 as well.

## Running:

Double click the script. It's just that easy.

## Reporting:

The goal of this tool is to crowdsource data collection about ritual. If you use this tool, please share your logs in the Prohibited Library discord: https://discord.gg/3VxKY6gt7j
A more sustainable reporting method may be developed in the future.
